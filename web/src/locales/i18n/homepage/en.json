The overarching goal is to support a transparent, high integrity global carbon market that can channel capital for impactful climate action and low-carbon development.",
    "faqTitle": "Common questions: ",
    "faqQ1": "What is a Carbon Registry?",
    "faqA1": "A carbon registry acts like a digital logbook, and is used to track and record carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for organizations, businesses, or individuals. It plays a key role in managing carbon emissions and reducing carbon footprints. By using a carbon registry, emission sources can be identified, and strategies can be implemented to reduce them. This helps combat climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "faqQ2": "How does a Carbon Registry promote transparency and integrity in carbon credits?",
    "faqA2": "Our carbon registry is built on a foundation of transparency and integrity, ensuring credibility and trust with all stakeholders. We achieve this through the following key practices:<ol><li><b>Scope:</b> The registry covers all significant greenhouse gas emissions and removals across the country, encompassing all sectors and gases. This comprehensive coverage provides a complete picture of national efforts to manage and reduce carbon emissions.</li><li><b>Transparency:</b> We ensure full transparency by making all information about emissions and removals publicly available. This includes the disclosure of both direct emissions from our facilities and indirect emissions from activities like business travel or electricity consumption. Additionally, we openly document all emission reduction measures, clearly outlining their expected impact on total emissions. By providing open access to this data, we foster understanding, build trust, and encourage active participation from stakeholders in carbon reduction efforts.</li><li><b>Consistency:</b> Our carbon registry aligns with internationally recognized accounting rules, methodologies, and guidelines, particularly those provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This ensures that our reporting is consistent, comparable with global standards, and meets international expectations for carbon accounting.</li><li><b>Integrity and Accuracy:</b> To uphold the accuracy and credibility of our data, the registry undergoes regular reviews and independent validation by third parties. Our transparent data collection process follows established methodologies and employs reliable measurement tools, ensuring the completeness and precision of every report. These rigorous practices guarantee that our emissions data and reduction strategies are both reliable and trustworthy.</li></ol>",
    "faqQ3": "How does a government adopt a National Carbon Registry?",
    "faqA3": "National governments can adopt and customize the National Carbon Registry using the open-source code. Reusing code can reduce development time and costs by up to 70%. To successfully implement the registry, we recommend having the following in place: <ul><li><b>Carbon Market Framework:</b> Ensure a robust carbon market framework has been defined, with an expert to help adapt it to digital processes.</li><li><b>Digital Team:</b> A local full stack digital team (including product design and development skills) to customize the registry to local needs, install it securely, and ensure smooth operation.</li><li><b>Implementation Task Force:</b> A dedicated team in government (across both policy areas and IT) to lead the implementation and manage/administer the system once operational. The team will also need to engage users, mobilize usage, and monitor changes in needs. Within the task force, we recommend having a dedicated Project Owner who can make key decisions and maintain pace. </li><li><b>Maintenance Budget and Resources:</b> The digital tool will need maintenance and improvement over time, and we recommend setting aside a sufficient budget and IT resources to maintain and improve the registry after installation.</li></ul>",
    "faqQ4": "What support can UNDP provide?",
    "faqA4": "The UNDP Digital for Planet team, through your local country office, can offer support in several areas (subject to discussion):<ul><li><b>Resources and Templates:</b> Access to template workplans, process flows, and other tools to assist in the customization and configuration of the system.</li><li><b>International Expertise:</b> Support from experts in product management, IT, carbon markets, and policy to provide guidance, ensure quality assurance, and facilitate knowledge transfer</li><li><b>Community of Practice:</b> Ongoing access to an international community of practice for support and collaboration.</li></ul>",
    "faqQ5": "What types of customizations can be allowed?",
    "faqA5": "The following customizations have been made by various countries:<ul><li><b>Process Flow:</b> Adapting the steps and workflow for the carbon market.</li><li><b>User Types:</b> The categories of users, roles, responsibilities and rights for each in the digital system.</li><li><b>Approval Authorities:</b> Defining which government bodies approve specific actions and how.</li><li><b>Documentation:</b> Customizing the types of documents required.</li><li><b>Data Requirements:</b> Adjusting the data required from developers.</li><li><b>API Integration:</b> Enabling automated data input/export through APIs to integrate with other local and national systems.</li><li><b>Bilateral Carbon Trading:</b> Adapting the registry for specific bilateral carbon trading agreements.</li><li><b>Data Hosting & Security:</b> Customizing data hosting locations, databases, and security protocols to meet the country’s unique requirements.</li></ul>",
    "faqQ6": "Where is data hosted?",
    "faqA6": "This demo site is hosted on UNDP’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. By using AWS, we leverage Amazon’s Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB), which provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log, ensuring a reliable and complete history of data changes.",
    "faqA6-2": "After installation, countries are expected to host and maintain the software independently. There are two main hosting options:<ul><li><b>Cloud Hosting:</b> Cloud hosting offers flexibility, reliability, and integrated security, along with backup and maintenance features. Hosting on AWS (through an account owned and managed by the country government) allows countries to take full advantage of the Quantum Ledger Database with minimal configuration changes required from the original source code.</li><li><b>Local Hosting:</b> Countries can choose to host the system on local servers or other cloud platforms to gain more direct control over data and security. In this case, countries will need to manage all configuration, security, backup, and ongoing maintenance based on their local IT environment and security protocols.</li></ul>",
    "faqQ7": "Who can use the source code?",
    "faqA7": "The tool is developed and maintained by UNDP and is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0), which permits free use, modification, and sharing of the software.",
    "faqA7-2": "We kindly ask users to inform us of your usage by contacting <a>digital4planet@undp.org</a> as this helps us track the tool’s impact and guide future improvements.",
    "faqA7-3": "Under AGPL-3.0, any modifications to the code must be made publicly available by creating a new branch on GitHub. The software cannot be relicensed under more restrictive terms without adhering to the AGPL-3.0 guidelines.",
